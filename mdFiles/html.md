HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. HTML was originally designed to be a publishing format for web documents, or pages. From that original definition web programmers have morphed the `web page` concept into a `web application` where a page now represents either a `single page application` (SPA) or a large group of hyperlinked pages that form a `multi-page application` (MPA). By itself HTML is amazing, but to create a full web application we will need other technologies to style (CSS) our pages and make them interactive (JavaScript). For now, we will focus on creating the content structure with HTML.

Here is an example of a simple HTML document.

```html
Hello world
```

The first thing you noticed is that this looks like a simple text document. That is because text is valid HTML. In order to provide structure to our text we need to introduce the concept of `elements` and their associated `tag` representation.

## Elements and tags

HTML `elements` are represented with enclosing `tags` that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (`p`), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (`/`) before its name.

```html
<p>Hello world</p>
```

We can continue adding structure to the page with additional elements. Each of these elements may contain other elements that provide the structure of our web page. The `html` element represents the top level page structure. The `head` element contains metadata about the page and the page title. The `body` element represents the content structure. The `main` element represents the main content structure, as opposed to things like headers, footers, asides, and navigation content. These additional elements result in the following HTML page.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

However, when we `render` the HTML in a browser it would look exactly the same as our original simple text example. The reason for that is that HTML is almost completely about structure. The visual appearance of the web page won't really change until we start styling the page with CSS.

## Attributes

Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the `id` attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The `class` attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to delimit attribute values.

```html
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```

## Hyperlinks

One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (`a`) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (`href`). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

```html
<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```

## Complete example

HTML defines a header (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file. We can now add the header, some attributes, and more content to our document for a full example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        HTML welcomes you to the amazing world of
        <span class="topic">web programming</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What will this mean to you?</p>
      <p class="assignment">Learn more <a href="instruction.html">here</a>.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

![Intro HTML Example](htmlIntroduction.png)

Notice that the rendered document has almost no styling. That is because the entire purpose of HTML is to provide content and structure. The layout of the content is left almost entirely up to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). When styling was introduced with CSS, all of the HTML elements that defined style such as font, strike, and plaintext were deprecated.

## Common elements

Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

| element   | meaning                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `html`    | The page container                                                     |

| `iframe`  | Inline frame of another HTML page                                      |

## Comments

You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with `<!--` and ending it with `-->`. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

```html
<!-- commented text -->
```

## Special characters

HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the `entity` syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (`<`) you would instead use the less than entity (`&lt;`). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

| Character | Entity      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &amp;     | `&amp;`     |
| <         | `&lt;`      |
| >         | `&gt;`      |
| "         | `&quot;`    |
| '         | `&apos;`    |
| &#128512; | `&#128512;` |

## HTML Versions

Understanding when different HTML features were introduced helps you know what has been around for a long time and probably supported by all browsers, and what is new and may not work everywhere. HTML is pretty stable, but it is still good to check a website like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#browser_compatibility) or [canIUse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_p) to make sure.

| Year | Version | Features                                  |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTML1   | format tags                               |
| 1995 | HTML2   | tables, internationalization              |
| 1997 | HTML3   | MathML, CSS, frame tags                   |
| 1999 | HTML4   | external CSS                              |
| 2014 | HTML5   | email, password, media, and semantic tags |

## index.html

By default a web server will display the HTML file named `index.html` when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for `https://google.com` in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file `https://google.com/index.html`. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application `index.html`.

## Rendering HTML

You can save any HTML file to your computer's disk and then open the file using your browser. You can also open the HTML file in VS Code and use the Live Server extension to display the HTML. Another way to easily play with HTML is to use a sandbox like [CodePen](https://codepen.io). However, when you use CodePen it is not necessary to supply the HTML DocType header or the root `html` element since CodePen already assumes you are providing HTML. Here is our example HTML document rendered in CodePen.

# HTML input elements

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

## Form element

The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

## Input element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

| Type           | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| text           | Single line textual value         |
| password       | Obscured password                 |
| email          | Email address                     |
| tel            | Telephone number                  |
| url            | URL address                       |
| number         | Numerical value                   |
| checkbox       | Inclusive selection               |
| radio          | Exclusive selection               |
| range          | Range limited number              |
| date           | Year, month, day                  |
| datetime-local | Date and time                     |
| month          | Year, month                       |
| week           | Week of year                      |
| color          | Color                             |
| file           | Local file                        |
| submit         | button to trigger form submission |

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

![HTML Input](htmlInput.jpg)

## Validating input

Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the `required` attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.

# HTML media elements

The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `audio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`. The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

## External media

The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

```html
https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
```

A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named `images` that contains a file named `photo.jpg` you would use a relative path as follows.

```html
images/photo.jpg
```

### Image

To include an image in your content you use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
In order to support accessibility, you should also include an `alt` attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

```html
<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
```

![mountain landscape](htmlImage.jpg)

### Audio

To include an audio file in your content you use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the `controls` attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

![Html Audio](htmlAudioImg.jpg)

### Video

To include a video in your content you use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes.

⚠ Note that you may need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```

![HTML video](htmlVideoImg.jpg)

## Internal media

The internal media elements `svg` and `canvas` allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
```

![SVG demo](htmlSvg.jpg)

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/mdKjMLY) for an example.

Consult the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

### Canvas

The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

```html
<canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>
```

# HTML structure elements

The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include `body`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section` `aside`, `p`, `table`, `ol/ul`, `div`, and `span`. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top level content `body`. The body has three children, a `header`, `main`, and `footer`. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

The `header` contains a `p`aragraph with a `span`, and a `nav`igation containing multiple `div`isions of sub-content.

The `main` contains multiple `section`s that contain either an unordered list (`ul`) or a `table`. Main also contains an `aside` for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The `footer` has a content division with a single span.

```html
<body>

If we rendered this HTML, and added just a bit of styling, so we can see how they related to each other, we would see the following.

![HTML structure](htmlStructure.jpg)

Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

## Block and inline

There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element `div` (division) could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a `p` (paragraph) element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.</p>
```
