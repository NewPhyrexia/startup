# Toolchains

As web programming becomes more and more complex it became necessary to abstract away some of that complexity with a series of tools. Some common functional pieces in a web application tool chain include:

- **Code repository** - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
- **Linter** - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
- **Prettier** - Formats code according to a shared standard.
- **Transpiler** - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript, TypeScript to JavaScript, or SCSS to CSS.
- **Polyfill** - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
- **Bundler** - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
- **Minifier** - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
- **Testing** - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
- **Deployment** - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.

The toolchain that we use for our React project consists of [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the code repository, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for JSX, TS, development and debugging support, [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for converting to ES6 modules and transpiling (with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) underneath), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for bundling and tree shaking, [PostCSS]() for CSS transpiling, and finally a simple bash script (deployReact.sh) for deployment.

You don't have to fully understand what each of these pieces in the chain are accomplishing, but the more you know about them the more you can optimize your development efforts.

In the following instruction we will show you how to use Vite to create a simple web application using the tools mentioned above. We will then demonstrate how to convert your startup into a modern web application by converting Simon to use Vite and React.

# Reactivity

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: `props`, `state`, and `render`.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's `state` or `prop` objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's `render` function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

The following example contains two components: a parent `<Survey/>` component and a child `<Question/>` component. The Survey has a state named `color`. The Question has a property named `color`. The Survey passes its `color` state to the Question as a property. This means that any change to the Survey's color will also be reflected in the Question's color. This is a powerful means for a parent to control a child's functionality.

The Question component also has a state named `answer`. The value of answer is displayed as part of the Question's content. The user can interact with this state through HTML radio input elements. When one of the inputs is changed the Question's `onChange` function is called and the answer state is updated to reflect the user's choice. This automatically causes the display of the answer to be updated.

Be careful about your assumptions of when state is updated. Just because you called `updateState` does not mean that you can access the updated state on the next line of code. The update happens asynchronously, and therefore you never really know when it is going to happen; you only know that it will eventually happen.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [color, updateColor] = React.useState('#737AB0');

  // When the color changes update the state
  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateColor(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the Question.
          When the color changes the Question property will also be updated and rendered. */}
      <Question color={color} />

      <p>
        <span>Pick a color: </span>
        {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the input element.
            When the color changes, the input property will also be updated and rendered. */}
        <input type='color' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} value={color} />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ color }) => {
  const [answer, updateAnswer] = React.useState('pending...');

  function onChange({ target }) {
    updateAnswer(target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Do you like this</span>
      {/* Color rerendered whenever the property changes */}
      <span style={{ color: color }}> color</span>?
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='yes' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        Yes
      </label>
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='no' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        No
      </label>
      {/* Answer rerendered whenever the state changes */}
      <p>Your answer: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Survey />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a fork of this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzYzXE) and experiment. Try changing the input from using the color and radio button, to using an edit box that reactively displays the text as you type.

When you are done submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository `notes.md` with all of the things you learned and want to remember.

### ðŸ§§ Possible solution

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [text, updateText] = React.useState('');

  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateText(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      <Question text={text} />

      <p>
        <span>Type some text: </span>
        <input type='text' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} placeholder='type here' />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You typed: {text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# React hooks

ðŸ“– **Recommended reading**: [Reactjs.org - Hooks Overview](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

React hooks allow React function style components to be able to do everything that a class style component can do and more. Additionally, as new features are added to React they are including them as hooks. This makes function style components the preferred way of doing things in React. You have already seen one use of hooks to declare and update state in a function component with the `useState` hook.

```jsx
function Clicker({initialCount}) {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(initialCount);
  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>Click count: {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Clicker initialCount={3} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## useEffect hook

The `useEffect` hook allows you to represent lifecycle events. For example, if you want to run a function every time the component completes rendering, you could do the following.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');
  });

  return <div>useEffectExample</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

You can also take action when the component cleans up by returning a cleanup function from the function registered with `useEffect`. In the following example, every time the component is clicked the state changes and so the component is rerendered. This causes both the cleanup function to be called in addition to the hook function. If the function was not rerendered then only the cleanup function would be called.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');

    return function cleanup() {
      console.log('cleanup');
    };
  });

  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>useEffectExample {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This is useful when you want to create side effects for things such as tracking when a component is displayed or hidden, or creating and disposing of resources.

## Hook dependencies

You can control what triggers a `useEffect` hook by specifying its dependencies. In the following example we have two state variables, but we only want the `useEffect` hook to be called when the component is initially called and when the first variable is clicked. To accomplish this you pass an array of dependencies as a second parameter to the `useEffect` call.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count1, updateCount1] = React.useState(0);
  const [count2, updateCount2] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`count1 effect triggered ${count1}`);
  }, [count1]);

  return (
    <ol>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount1(count1 + 1)}>Item 1 - {count1}</li>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount2(count2 + 1)}>Item 2 - {count2}</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

If you specify and empty array `[]` as the hook dependency then it is only called when the component is first rendered.

Note that hooks can only be used in function style components and must be called at the top scope of the function. That means a hook cannot be called inside of a loop or conditional. This restriction ensures that hooks are always called in the same order when a component is rendered.

# Router

ðŸ”‘ **Required reading**: [React Router DOM Tutorial](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-router/)

A web framework router provides essential functionality for single-page applications. With a multiple-webpage application the headers, footers, navigation, and common components must be either duplicated in each HTML page, or injected before the server sends the page to the browser. With a single page application, the browser only loads one HTML page and then JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and give it the appearance of multiple pages. The router defines the routes a user can take through the application, and automatically manipulates the DOM to display the appropriate framework components.

React does not have a standard router package, and there are many that you can choose from. We will use [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) Version 6. The simplified routing functionality of React-router-dom derives from the project [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) for its core functionality. Do not confuse the two, or versions of react-router-dom before version 6, when reading tutorials and documentation.

![React Router](routerExample.gif)

A basic implementation of the router consists of a `BrowserRouter` component that encapsulates the entire application and controls the routing action. The `Link`, or `NavLink`, component captures user navigation events and modifies what is rendered by the `Routes` component by matching up the `to` and `path` attributes.

```jsx
// Inject the router into the application root DOM element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  // BrowserRouter component that controls what is rendered
  // NavLink component captures user navigation requests
  // Routes component defines what component is routed to
  <BrowserRouter>
    <div className='app'>
      <nav>
        <NavLink to='/'>Home</Link>
        <NavLink to='/about'>About</Link>
        <NavLink to='/users'>Users</Link>
      </nav>

      <main>
        <Routes>
          <Route path='/' element={<Home />} exact />
          <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
          <Route path='/users' element={<Users />} />
          <Route path='*' element={<Navigate to='/' replace />} />
        </Routes>
      </main>
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

# Vite

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

Now that we have covered the basics of React, we want to extend our usage to include a full web framework toolchain that allows us to use JSX, minification, polyfills, and bundling for our Simon and startup applications. One common way for configuring your project to take advantage of these technologies is to use a Command Line Interface (CLI) to initially set up a web application. Using a CLI saves you the trouble of configuring the toolchain parameters and gets you quickly started with a default application.

For our toolchain we are going to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Vite bundles your code quickly, has great debugging support, and allows you to easily support JSX, TypeScript, and different CSS flavors. To get started with Vite, let's first build a simple web application. Later we will convert Simon over to React using Vite. This will teach you what you need to know in order to move your startup to React.

To create a new React-based web application using Vite, open your console and run the following commands:

```sh
npm create vite@latest demoVite -- --template react
cd demoVite
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a new web application in the `demoVite` directory, download the required 3rd party packages, and start up the application using a local HTTP debugging server. You can tell Vite to open your browser to the URL that is hosting your application by pressing `o`, or press `h` to see all of the Vite CLI options.

![Vite Demo](viteDemo.gif)

Congratulations! You have just created your first React-enabled web application.

Once you have played around with the application in your browser, you can return to your console and stop Vite from hosting the application by pressing `q`.

## Generated project

Now, let's explore the application files that Vite created. From the console, use VS Code (`code .`) to open the project directory and take a look at the files.

| Directory    | File              | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ./           |                   |                                                                                                                                |
|              | index.html        | Primary page for the application. This is the starting point to load all of the JSX components beginning with `main.jsx`. |
|              | package.json      | NPM definition for package dependencies and script commands. This is what maps `npm run dev` to actually start up Vite.   |
|              | package-lock.json | Version constraints for included packages (do not edit this).                                                             |
|              | vite.config.js    | Configuration setting for Vite. Specifically this sets up React for development.                                          |
| ./public     |                   |                                                                                                                           |
|              | vite.svg          | Vite logo for use as favicon and for display in the app.                                                                  |
| ./src        |                   |                                                                                                                           |
|              | main.jsx          | Entry point for code execution. This simply loads the App component found in `App.jsx`.                                   |
|              | index.css         | CSS for the entire application.                                                                                           |
|              | App.jsx           | JSX for top level application component. This displays the logs and implements the click counter.                         |
|              | App.css           | CSS for the top level application component.                                                                              |
| ./src/assets |                   |                                                                                                                           |
|              | react.svg         | React logo for display in the app.                                                                                        |

The main files in the application are `index.html`, `main.jsx`, and `App.jsx`. The browser loads `index.html` which provides the HTML element (`#root`) that the React application will be injected into. It also includes the script element to load `main.jsx`.

`main.jsx` creates the React application by associating the `#root` element with the `App` component found in `App.jsx`. This causes all of the component render functions to execute and the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be executed in `index.html`.

![File relationship](reactFiles.png)

## JSX vs JS

The `Vite` CLI uses the `.jsx` extension for JSX files instead of the JavaScript `.js` extension. The Babel transpiler will work with either one, but some editor tools will work differently based upon the extension. For this reason, you should prefer `.jsx` for files that contain JSX. The developers at AirBNB had an interesting [conversation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/985) on this topic that you might browse if you would like to consider the differing opinions on this subject.

## Building a production release

When you execute `npm run dev` you are bundling the code to a temporary directory that the Vite debug HTTP server loads from. When you want to bundle your application so that you can deploy to a production environment you need to run `npm run build`. This executes the `build` script found in your `package.json` and invokes the `Vite` CLI. `vite build` transpiles, minifies, injects the proper JavaScript, and then outputs everything to a deployment-ready version contained in a distribution subdirectory named `dist`.

```sh
âžœ  npm run build

> demovite@0.0.0 build
> vite build

vite v4.3.7 building for production...
âœ“ 34 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.45 kB â”‚ gzip:  0.30 kB
dist/assets/react-35ef61ed.svg    4.13 kB â”‚ gzip:  2.14 kB
dist/assets/index-51439b3f.css    1.42 kB â”‚ gzip:  0.74 kB
dist/assets/index-58d24859.js   143.42 kB â”‚ gzip: 46.13 kB
âœ“ built in 382ms
```

## Deploying a production release

The deployment script for Simon React (`deployReact.sh`) creates a production distribution by calling `npm run build` and then copying the resulting `dist` directory to your production server.

Take some time to build a production release by running `npm run build`. Then examine what Vite actually builds by examining the `dist` directory. For example, if you look at the `dist/assets` directory you will see the bundled and minified JavaScript and CSS files.

## â˜‘ Assignment

Now that you have reviewed the application in VS Code, take a moment to manipulate the files and see what impact your changes have. If you break the application, and can't figure out how to fix it, just delete the demo directory and start again. The more you play around with this code, the better you will understand how all the pieces of the application fit together.

Make the following modifications:

1. Alter the CSS to change background and text colors to something different.
1. Replace the text in the App component with your name.
1. Change the counter to increment by 10 instead of by one.

After these changes, the application should look similar to this:

![React altered](reactAppAltered.png)

When you are done, submit a screen capture of the altered application to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository `notes.md` with all of the things you learned and want to remember.
